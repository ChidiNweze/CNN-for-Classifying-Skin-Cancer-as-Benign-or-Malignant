# CNN-for-Classifying-Skin-Cancer-as-Benign-or-Malignant
A simple convolutional neural network for classifying skin cancer as benign or malignant made with Keras and TensorFlow.

MOTIVATION & GOALS

As I become more interested in machine learning, I wanted to try out a classification problem, but one that had real-life applications and impact. A machine learning application for identifying skin cancer as benign or malignant could save many lives and counter human error. After an eventful January full of hackathons and side project, I took a break in February. This small project is an attempt to ease myself back into programming after many meaningful naps and Netflix binges. 

TOOLS USED

* Made in a Jupyter notebook
* matplotlib for peeking at the photos and visualizing cross entropy loss and accuracy (in graphs also uploaded as a .png to the repository)
* Keras,especially it's preprocessing library which made everything a whole lot easier and quicker
* Tensorflow


FUTURE?

In the future, I would love to integrate this model into a mobile application that healthcare professionals or patients alike can use everyday. I think my next project just might be a mobile application that leverages machine learning. ðŸ¤” Stay tuned.
